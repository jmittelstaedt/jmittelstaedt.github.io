        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p class="main-text">
          I'm currently a third year physics Ph.D student doing experimental condensed matter
          physics research in Dan Ralph's group at Cornell.
          My subfield is spintronics, which has the aim of better utilizing electron spin in 
          various forms for computation and data storage.
          To do this effectively, we need to be able to create currents of <i>spin</i>, that is 
          a flow of electrons with a coherent spin direction.
          This is still an active area of research, and my work generally involves looking at
          new materials which may be able to generate spin currents efficiently and seeing how good
          they actually are at doing that.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          For any experts, in particular I am working on measuring spin currents produced by 
          ferromagnets in the hope that the broken symmetry offered by the magnetization 
          can be useful in generating spin currents with more flexible polarization.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          I'm also involved in generally making our techniques for measuring charge-spin conversion
          more accuarate, as well as at least somewhat involved in our group's efforts to investigate
          2D van der Waals magnetic materials.

        <p class="main-text">
         I love playing around with Python and have been using it as well as the general scientific
         and numerical python ecosystem for several years in the course of research.
         Over this time, I've begun to make and contribute to some code which may actually be 
         of use to people. If you're interested, I'd suggest that you check out my
         <a href="https://github.com/jmittelstaedt" id="github-link" target="blank">github profile</a> which has a decent 
         selection of the notable things I've done. Also, for what it's worth, I wrote all the HTML and CSS for this webpage myself!
